  
Some parts of Acts 16 are written in the first person because the author, Luke, includes himself as a participant in the events described. In Acts, there are certain sections where the narrative shifts to the first person plural ("we" and "us"), indicating that Luke was personally present and involved in those specific situations. This suggests that Luke was an eyewitness to some of the events he records, particularly during his travels with Paul. It is believed that Luke, as a companion of Paul, joined him on certain missionary journeys, and those experiences are reflected in the use of the first person perspective in the book of Acts.

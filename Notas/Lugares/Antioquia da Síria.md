  
The difference between Syrian Antioch and Pisidian Antioch lies primarily in their geographical locations and the regions they belong to:

1.  Syrian Antioch: Syrian Antioch, also known as Antioch on the Orontes, was a prominent city located in the region of Syria. It was situated near the Orontes River and was one of the major centers of the early Christian church. Syrian Antioch is mentioned numerous times in the New Testament, particularly in the Acts of the Apostles.
    
2.  Pisidian Antioch: Pisidian Antioch, on the other hand, was a city located in the region of Pisidia within the Roman province of Galatia. It was situated in modern-day Turkey. Pisidian Antioch is specifically mentioned in Acts 13 and Acts 14, where Paul and Barnabas visited and preached in the local synagogue.
    

While both cities were named Antioch, they were distinct and separate locations. Syrian Antioch held greater prominence and played a significant role in the early Christian movement, serving as a hub for missionary activities and the sending-off point for Paul's missionary journeys. Pisidian Antioch, though less well-known, was an important stop on Paul's first missionary journey in his efforts to spread the gospel to different regions.
